SOP 01 - Fetch Ticket
Tool: tools/jira_fetch.py · Layer: 3 · Purity: I/O only, no interpretation

Goal
Turn a Jira issue key into the raw JSON Jira returns. Nothing more. No parsing, no field mapping, no opinions.

Inputs
key: str matching ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+$
credentials from tools/config_store.py (jira_url, jira_email, jira_api_token)
Logic
Validate the key against the pattern. Invalid -> InvalidKeyError before any network call.
GET {jira_url}/rest/api/3/issue/{key} with:
fields= explicit list (never *all, it burns LLM context with noise)
expand=renderedFields,names (HTML cross-check + the field-name map for SOP 02)
Basic auth, Accept: application/json, timeout 20s
Fetch comments separately: GET /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/comment?maxResults=50&orderBy=-created
Fetch remote links: GET /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/remotelink
Comments and remote links are best-effort. A failure there degrades the result, it does not fail the run. The core issue call is the only one that can fail hard.
Write the raw response to .tmp/{key}_raw.json. It is both the fixture and the audit trail.
Edge cases
Case	Behavior
200 with an HTML body	JiraError: "JIRA_URL points at the web app, not the API"
400	JiraError echoing Jira's errorMessages verbatim
401	AuthenticationError: "regenerate the API token"
403	PermissionError: account cannot read this project
404	NotFoundError: "not found OR no browse permission", always both (BR-16)
429	retry honouring Retry-After, max 3 attempts, then RateLimitError
5xx	retry with backoff 1s/2s/4s, then JiraError
timeout / DNS	ConnectionError naming the URL it tried
Output
dict with keys issue, comments, remote_links, _meta (status, ms, retries).

Rules cited
BR-15 (errors name the fix), BR-16 (404 conflation), BR-9 (never log the token), AI-4 (explicit paths, no cwd dependence).
