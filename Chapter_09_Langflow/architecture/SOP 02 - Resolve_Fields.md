SOP 02 - Resolve Fields
Tool: tools/field_map.py · Layer: 3 · Purity: pure given the names map

Goal
Find the Acceptance Criteria custom field id for this Jira site, at runtime. Never hardcode customfield_10034.

Why this SOP exists
On Jira Cloud there is no standard Acceptance Criteria field. The id differs per site. The prior-art client in chapter_03 falls back to scanning field keys for the substring "acceptance", which can never match on Cloud, where keys are customfield_10034 and the human name lives in the names map. That is risk R2 and it is the single most likely cause of a silently wrong plan.

Inputs
names: dict[str, str] from expand=names on the issue response (field id -> display name)
Logic
Scan names for a display name matching (?i)acceptance|criteria|definition of done.
Rank hits: exact "Acceptance Criteria" beats "AC" beats "Definition of Done".
Return {"acceptance_criteria": "customfield_XXXXX" | None} plus the human name that matched.
Cache per site in config.json under field_map_cache. The map is stable per site; re-resolving on every run is wasted latency.
Edge cases
Case	Behavior
No match	Return None. Not an error. SOP 03 falls through to description-heading parsing.
Multiple matches	Take the highest-ranked, record all candidates in the trace
names absent (expand dropped)	Return None and record a gap, do not crash
Output
{"acceptance_criteria": str|None, "matched_name": str|None, "candidates": list}

Rules cited
BR-2 (absence is data), R2.
