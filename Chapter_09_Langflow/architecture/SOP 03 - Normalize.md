SOP 03 - Normalize
Tools: tools/adf_flatten.py, tools/normalize.py · Layer: 3 · Purity: both pure

Goal
Raw Jira JSON -> one ticket.json that validates against schemas/ticket.schema.json. This is the only interface into the rest of the system (AI-1).

Part A: ADF flattening (adf_flatten.py)
Jira Cloud v3 returns fields.description as an Atlassian Document Format tree. A naive extractor that concatenates text nodes loses all structure: headings, bullet boundaries, table cells, code blocks. For test planning that structure is the requirement.

Node handling, ADF type -> markdown:

ADF node	Markdown
doc	walk children
heading (attrs.level)	# * level
paragraph	text + blank line
bulletList / listItem	-  with 2-space nesting
orderedList	1.  with nesting
table / tableRow / tableHeader / tableCell	pipe table, header separator after row 1
codeBlock (attrs.language)	fenced block
blockquote	>  prefix
rule	---
panel (attrs.panelType)	> **NOTE:** blockquote
text with marks	**bold**, *em*, `code`, ~~strike~~, [text](href)
hardBreak	newline
mediaSingle / media	_[attachment: filename]_
inlineCard / blockCard	<url>
emoji	attrs.text
mention	@displayName
unknown	recurse into content, and record the type in unknown_nodes
unknown_nodes is load-bearing. It is how ADF drift becomes visible instead of becoming silent data loss.

Self-check: compare the flattened text length against the text stripped from renderedFields.description HTML. A delta over 25% means a node type was dropped. Recorded in the trace as html_crosscheck_delta_pct (risk R3).

Part B: Acceptance criteria extraction (normalize.py)
Four strategies, in order, first hit wins. The one that fired is recorded in origin:

custom_field - the id from SOP 02, flattened if ADF
description_heading - a heading matching (?i)acceptance criteria|^ac$ in the flattened markdown, take everything until the next heading of the same or higher level
comment - a comment whose first 200 chars match the AC pattern (only if enabled)
none -> acceptance_criteria: [] plus a gaps[] entry. Never an invented list (BR-1, BR-2).
Splitting: bullet lines become one AC each; Given/When/Then blocks stay together as one AC.

Part C: Assembly
Build the object exactly as schemas/ticket.schema.json requires, then validate. A violation raises SchemaError naming the offending path (AI-5, T-2).

gaps[] is populated for: no description, no acceptance criteria, no components, no fix version, no sprint dates, no environment.
