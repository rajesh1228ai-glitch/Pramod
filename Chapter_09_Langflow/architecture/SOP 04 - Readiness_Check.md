SOP 04 - Readiness Check
Tool: tools/readiness.py · Layer: 3 · Purity: pure

Goal
Decide whether this ticket is plannable at all. The agent must be willing to return no plan (BR-4).

Why
A confident test plan built on an empty ticket is worse than no plan, because it gets reviewed and approved. The gap report is the useful output in that case: it names exactly what to add to the ticket.

Scoring
Signal	Points	Notes
Summary present, >= 3 words	2	required
Description >= 200 chars	3	the main substance
Description >= 40 chars	1	partial credit
>= 1 acceptance criterion	3	strongest signal
>= 3 acceptance criteria	+1	bonus
Components or labels present	1	scope hints
Fix version or sprint present	1	schedule input
Threshold: 5 of 11. Below it -> plannable: false.

Chosen so that summary + a real description (5) passes, and summary + one-line description (3) does not. A ticket with acceptance criteria and a summary (5) always passes.

Output
{"plannable": bool, "score": int, "max": 11, "gaps": [...], "blockers": [...]}

blockers are the specific things to add to the ticket, phrased as instructions to the author: "Add acceptance criteria", "Expand the description beyond one line".

Behavior on false
Navigation stops. No LLM call is made, no plan file is written. The UI renders the gap report. Exit code 0, because refusing is correct behavior, not a failure (BR-4, BR-17).

Override
The UI exposes "plan anyway". If used, every generated section carries an assumption entry and the plan header states the ticket failed readiness. Explicit human choice, recorded.
