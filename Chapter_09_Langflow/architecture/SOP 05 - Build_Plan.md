SOP 05 - Build Plan
Tool: tools/plan_build.py · Layer: 3 · Purity: PROBABILISTIC, schema-gated

Goal
ticket.json -> plan.json conforming to schemas/plan.schema.json. This is the only component in the system permitted to call a model (AI-2).

Provider
Provider-agnostic across OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Selected by the llm_provider setting; both are called with requests and no SDK dependency.

Provider	Base URL	Default model	Default TPM budget
deepseek	https://api.deepseek.com/v1	deepseek-chat	60000
groq	https://api.groq.com/openai/v1	openai/gpt-oss-120b	8000
Temperature 0.2, response_format: {"type":"json_object"} on both.

The TPM budget is per provider because it drives the slimming loop below. Groq's free tier is tight (8000, and the max_tokens reservation counts against it), so a rich ticket gets slimmed. DeepSeek's ceiling is far higher, so slimming rarely engages and the model sees the full ticket. Same pipeline, same schema gate, different headroom.

Prompt contract
System: the role, the 6 standing instructions from LLM.md section 6, and the literal JSON schema. User: the whole ticket.json, pretty-printed.

The prompt does not contain the markdown template. The model never sees the output format, so it cannot drift from it. Format is render.py's job, and render.py cannot hallucinate. This inversion is what makes the placeholder sweep and section-order guarantee mechanical.

Standing instructions (each traceable to a rule)
Use only facts present in the supplied ticket object (BR-1)
Every scope entry needs justified_by naming the ticket fact. Cannot fill it -> drop the entry into dropped_scope (BR-3, BR-13)
Anything filled without ticket evidence goes in assumptions[] with a reason (BR-2)
Never invent URLs, dates, versions, names or tools (BR-1)
Formal QA tone, no emoji, no em dashes (BR-12)
Return JSON only
Retry policy
On schema violation: feed the validator's error message back to the model and retry. Maximum 2 retries, then the run fails. Never hand-patch the model's output (BR-18).

Edge cases
Case	Behavior
No API key	LLMError naming the Settings page
401 from Groq	"Groq API key rejected, check Settings"
429	honour Retry-After, 2 attempts
Model returns prose around the JSON	strip to the outermost {...} before parsing, then validate
Still invalid after 2 retries	fail the run, write no plan file (BR-17)
Ticket over the context budget	progressive slimming, see below
413 from Groq (TPM limit)	slim harder and retry once, then report the tier limit and the exact token counts
Token budget and progressive slimming
Groq enforces a tokens-per-minute cap per organisation and tier (8,000 TPM on the free tier for openai/gpt-oss-120b). A rich ticket plus the pretty-printed schema exceeded it during the first live run: 13,910 requested against an 8,000 limit.

The payload is therefore slimmed before the call, cheapest loss first:

Level	What is dropped	Why it is safe
always	description_html	It exists ONLY for the flattener loss cross-check in normalize. The model never needed it, and it roughly doubles the description's size.
always	unknown_adf_nodes, source, fetched_at, url	Bookkeeping. Not requirements.
always	schema is minified, not pretty-printed	Same information, far fewer tokens
1	attachments reduced to filenames	Sizes and mime types do not inform a plan
2	comments capped at 5, each truncated to 400 chars	Comments are supporting context, not the requirement
3	comments dropped entirely	
4	description_md truncated to 6000 chars	Last resort, because this IS the requirement
Any level at or above 2 records a gap on the ticket so the truncation appears in the deliverable rather than being silent (BR-2).

Estimation uses 4 characters per token, which is approximate. The loop slims until the estimate fits the budget, and slims one level further on a real 413.

max_tokens counts against the TPM limit. This is the non-obvious part, and it cost two failed runs to find. Groq bills the reservation, not the actual completion length, so prompt_tokens + max_tokens must fit inside the tier's TPM. With a 2,669-token prompt and max_tokens: 8000, Groq reported "Requested 10669" against an 8000 limit: the prompt was never the problem, the reservation was. So max_tokens is computed per call as tpm_limit - estimated_prompt_tokens - safety_margin, floored at 1500 (below which a full plan cannot be returned) and capped at 8000. The TPM limit is a setting, defaulting to 8000 for the Groq free tier.

Output
plan.json in .tmp/, plus the token counts, the slim level used, and the attempt number for the trace.
