Fixtures
Offline test data. No network needed (invariant AI-8).

File	What it is
BOOK-214_raw.json	A rich ticket: ADF headings, bullets, a table, a code block, a warning panel, a rule, bold and link marks, an expand node the flattener does not know (deliberate, to prove unknown_adf_nodes works), plus acceptance criteria in customfield_10034, components, fix version, links and an attachment.
BOOK-999_raw.json	A deliberately thin ticket: two-word summary, four-word description, no acceptance criteria. Proves the readiness refusal path (BR-4).
sample_plan.json	A hand-written test fixture, not model output. It exists so render.py and the output gates can be tested without calling Groq.
These are synthetic tickets, not real Jira data. Replace BOOK-214 with a captured real response once live credentials are available (Phase 2 fixture capture).
